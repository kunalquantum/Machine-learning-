# Machine-learning-
basic steps (approach)
1.DATA  
(DATA GATHERING ) : a) data cleaining : prerossing
(here we will save on;i te eanted)
libraries : numpy , pandas

2.DATA SPLITTING 
data is classified into :
x, y

x : questions (features )
y: indepedent variable

3. divide the data into training and testing data:
(90:10) 
-Xtrain 80%
-Ytrain 80%

xtest 20%
ytest @20%

4.
model selection
(choose machine learining alogruthm model)
 calling the model 
sklearn 
-xtrain
-ytrain

5 model accuracy (tast- xtext)
  yash will give answers wil store in y_pred variable 
  we will compare
  y_pred == ytest
 if theaccracy is up to the  mark
 else
 repeat the step 4 with some changes 

6. if the model is passes the accurracy test 
we will go for the model deployment
